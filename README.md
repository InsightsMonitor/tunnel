# Tabulate Prime by 618

Within this development we will discuss about the interconnection between 168 and 618. Our pre-release has mapped the primes to π(1000)=168 as the main lexer. So the next target is about 618 as the main parser

One of the major case is that we will start with the lagging steps. The basic algorithm is Synthesis of leading and lagging strands of DNA.

<blockquote>The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of replication fork movement. The lagging strand is synthesized in small pieces (Okazaki fragments) backward from the overall direction of replication. The Okazaki fragments are then joined by the action of DNA ligase.</blockquote>

Beaides it, there is also strong signal that this parser will have the correlation with Φ=1,618 of _[(Golden Ratio)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Golden+Ratio)_ that leads to a kind of **gap and turbulences** in [the primes geometri](https://github.com/chetabahana) which hold the key of <code>init</code> as the road map to π(1000x1000).

So here it goes **1 Million Primes**.

## 4th Step: Q(114, 89)

It is clear that the primes are organized to generate another 1000 primes via a double flow of π(89) to π(89²). This 89 can only be acheived via bilateral 9 sums of the prime 43.

That what and why **18+13+12=43** located within **the last 9 cells** is standing for!

[<img width=100% src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/76146565-6f944300-60c6-11ea-829d-16f98dc94163.png">](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/)

From the above explanation about 43 and 89 then the prime flow in the developed flowchart above should take a connection to form between them two. This is the reason why the sequence of its shapes are arranged as below:

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103147412-5492dc80-4787-11eb-8277-4fa39ce28c90.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Therefore the 30th primes will bear the responsibility to generate the prime 43 while the 36th prime for the 89. 

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107818705-98c75400-6daa-11eb-8138-d6da7ceef4fd.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

This will take place on the 150 that should have a delta of Δ18 to the last number which is 168 where this 168 is exactly π(1000).

[<img width=100% src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/107850441-06b85d80-6e35-11eb-8787-b947d7c60c2e.png>](https://github.com/chetabahana/tensorflow/wiki/Programming)

Let's consider this flowchart of 168 as a lexer so the parser has to be designed to absorb the flow between the 30th and 36th. Then it will slightly form as a Metatron Cube of the hexagonal form of 18's Cell.

Here we assign it as the diagram of 618.
